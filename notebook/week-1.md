#Week 1

## The Problem
For the first week of the competition, our goal was to complete the first milestone. That is, we wanted to get our robot to start in the center of one of the quadrants and exit the quadrant. To complete this task, we needed to do the following:
* Design and create circuits for our two servo motors to interface with the Arduino microcontroller
* Adapt/design code to control the speed of the servos and the direction they spun
* Create a body to house the Arduino, breadboard, servos, and battery

## Getting Started
Our first objective was to connect the servo motors to the Arduino...

## Code
Once the servos were connected, the focus shifted to programming a...

```c++


```

## Designing the Body

Need to finish writing about circuit, code, and body, along with adding more pictures and acknowledgments.
